Disclaimer:

This is a independent documentation project based on a combination of static analysis
and trial and error on real hardware.  This work is 100% independent from and not
sanctioned by or connected with Broadcom or its agents.

No Broadcom documents or materials were used beyond those publically available 
(see Referenced Materials).

This work was undertaken and the information provided for non commercial use on the 
expectation that hobbyists of all ages will find the details useful for understanding 
and working with their Raspberry Pi hardware.

The hope is that Broadcom will be flattered by the interest in the device and
understand the benefits of opening up understanding to a larger audience of 
potential customers and developers.

Broadcom should be commended with making their SoC available for a project as 
exciting as the Raspberry Pi.

The intent is that no copyrighted materials are contained in this repository.

Introduction
==

Purpose of this repo: Documentation and samples on the VideoCore IV instruction set as used in the BCM SoC used in the Raspberry Pi.  As of early 2016, Broadcom has yet to release public information on the VPU, so it is hoped you find this repo useful.

The BCM2835 SoC (System on a Chip) in the original RaspberryPi has the following significant computation units:
- **(ARM)** ARM1176JZF-S 700 MHz processor which acts as the "main" processor and typically runs Linux.
- **([VPU](https://github.com/hermanhermitage/videocoreiv))** Dualcore Videocore IV CPU @250MHz with SIMD Parallel Pixel Units (PPU) which runs scalar (integer and float) and vector (integer only) programs. Runs ThreadX OS, and generally coordinates all functional blocks such as video codecs, power management, video out.
- **(ISP)** Image Sensor Pipeline (ISP) providing lens shading, statistics and distortion correction.
- **([QPU](https://github.com/hermanhermitage/videocoreiv-qpu))** QPU units which provide 24 GFLOPS compute performance for coordinate, vertex and pixel shaders.  Whilst originally not documented, Broadcom released documentation and source code for the QPU in 2014.

Newer Raspberry Pi mix things up with faster and more modern ARM cores, but the VPU information here is still relevant.
 
For more information on the Raspberry Pi, see the foundation's site at http://raspberrypi.org,
or the embedded linux wiki at http://elinux.org/R-Pi_Hub.

Active discussions take place on IRC (freenode) on #raspberrypi-internals, #raspberrypi-osdev, #raspberrypi-dev, 
and #raspberrypi.

There is a raspberrypi-internals mailing list, you can subscribe at <a href="http://www.freelists.org/list/raspi-internals">mailing list page at
freelists.org</a>.

We are in a very early stage of understanding of the device.  At this stage we only have Serial IO and GPIO for
flashing things like the status led.  You will need to attach a terminal to the Mini UART on the GPIO connector.
For more details see "Getting started" below.  

It is now possibly to use VideoCore Kernels from Userland / Linux, 
see https://github.com/hermanhermitage/videocoreiv/wiki/VideoCore-IV-Kernels-under-Linux.  Our understanding of the
Videocore Processor is nearing completion, and it is an excellent target for integer SIMD and DSP kernels.  Essentially,
it can be used for 16 way SIMD processing of 8, 16 and 32 bit integer values.

## Patents and Patent Applications

The original Alphamosaic patents and patent applications provide a wealth of information for understanding the
structure of the VideoCore instruction set and architecture.  Whilst the instruction encodings are different, and
only a limited range of instructions are indicated they prove an invaluable reference for understanding
the design space the engineers were exploring.

The newer Broadcom SoC patents and applications provide detailed information on how the VideoCore has been been
integrated into a broader platform setting.  They are invaluable for gaining a deeper insight into the additional
function units present in the BCM2835 and how they fit together.
